Spinlocks are not appropriate for single-processor systems because the
condition that would break a process out of the spinlock can be obtained
only by executing a different process. If the process is not relinquishing
the processor, other processes do not get the opportunity to set the
program condition required for the first process to make progress. In a
multiprocessor system, other processes execute on other processors and
thereby modify the program state in order to release the first process
from the spinlock.
