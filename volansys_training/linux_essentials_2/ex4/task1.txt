ans1:
Thread synchronization is defined as a mechanism 
which ensures that two or more concurrent processes or threads 
that do not simultaneously execute some particular program segment 
that known as critical section. Processes' access to critical section 
which is controlled by using synchronization techniques. 
When one thread starts executing the critical section 
(serialized segment of the program) 
the other thread should wait until the first thread finishes.


ans2:
The three thread synchronization mechanisms used on Linux are 
mutexes, barriers, and condvars.
