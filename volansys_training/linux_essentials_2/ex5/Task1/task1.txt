IPC:
IPC allow the processes to manage shared data. 
Typically, applications can use IPC, categorized as clients and servers, 
where the client requests data and the server responds to client requests.

IPC is very important to the design process for microkernels and nanokernels, 
which reduce the number of functionalities provided by the kernel.
